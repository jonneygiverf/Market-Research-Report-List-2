<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Overload Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Overload Relay</li><li>Electronic Overload Relays</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Overload relays are devices used to protect electrical motors from damage caused by excessive current. There are two main types of overload relays: thermal overload relays and electronic overload relays. </p><p>Thermal overload relays use a bimetallic strip that expands and contracts with temperature changes, to activate or deactivate the motor. These relays are reliable and cost-effective, commonly used in residential and light industrial applications. </p><p>On the other hand, electronic overload relays use sensors and microcontrollers to monitor the motor's current and temperature. They offer more precise protection, advanced features, and are often used in heavy industrial settings where accurate and reliable operation is crucial.</p></p>
