<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gauge Pressure Sensor ICs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Mount</li><li>Through Hole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gauge Pressure Sensor ICs are available in two main market types: Surface Mount and Through Hole. Surface Mount refers to the method of mounting the IC directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB) without any leads or holes. This allows for automated assembly and space-saving benefits. On the other hand, Through Hole involves inserting the IC into pre-drilled holes on the PCB and soldering it to secure the connection. This method is more durable but requires manual assembly and occupies more space.</p></p>
