<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Home Lighting Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Off-grid Solar</li><li>Grid-tied Solar</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The solar home lighting equipment market can be broadly categorized into two types: off-grid solar and grid-tied solar. Off-grid solar systems are independent and not connected to the utility grid. These systems rely on solar panels to generate electricity, which is stored in batteries for use during nighttime or when there is no sunlight. On the other hand, grid-tied solar systems are connected to the utility grid. They generate electricity from solar panels and feed any excess power back into the grid, earning credits or reducing electricity bills.</p></p>
