<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Wall Hung Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The gas wall hung boilers market consists of two major types: condensing and non-condensing boilers. Condensing boilers are more energy-efficient as they utilize waste heat from flue gases to pre-heat cold water, resulting in lower fuel consumption. They are also environmentally friendly as they produce less carbon dioxide emissions. Non-condensing boilers, on the other hand, do not utilize this waste heat and are less energy-efficient. They release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a result.</p></p>
